## Emtpy Chunks

Below is a chunk with now code:

```{.tcl}
```

Below is a chunk with an empty line:

```{.tcl}

```

Now a chunk which just puts a single line:


```{.tcl}
puts Hello
```


Now a chunk which just puts a single line but no endline marker:


```{.tcl}
puts -nonewline Hello
```

We should have a newline before the  closing triple backticks.

## Julia

```{.julia}
println("Hello")
```

Now a chunk which just puts a single line but no endline marker which will hang forever:

```{.julia}
print("Hello")
```

## Python

```{py}
print("Hello Python")
```


```{py}
print("Hello Python",end="")
```
