[description]

The package [package tmdoc] provides a command to evaluate embedded Tcl code in
code chunks within documents of Markup languages like Markdown and LaTeX and
add the resulting output to the document for creating dynamic documents, a technique
as well known as literate programming.

The latter uses Tcllib's [package Markdown] package.

The embedded Tcl code starts with tri backticks and a language marker like this:

[example {
```{.tcl}
puts "Hello World"
```
}]

This should be now evaluated.
