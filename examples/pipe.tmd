## Python Code Evaluation

As we can use R we can as well use Python in a similar way using the pipe code
chunk. Here an example:

```{.pipe pipe=python}
def hello():
    print("Hello Python World!\n")

hello()
x=2
```
   
```{.pipe pipe=python}
print(x)
``` 

Inlining Python code fragments should as well work:

The value of x is `py print(x)`.
