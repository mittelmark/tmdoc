\documentclass{article}

\begin{document}

For some reason the first statement is incomplete.

```{py}
print("Hello Python!")
```

Some more text

```{py}
print('This is a very long string!',flush=True)
```

```{py}
x = 1
print(x)
```


The value of x is `py x`!

```{py}
print("Hello Python World!")
```
